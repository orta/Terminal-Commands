Terminal-Commands
=================

Contains the Terminal commands I use on an everyday basis.

* start
  * A command which opens with either writing a new github issue or giving one as the first arguement, creates a branch based on the id, and notes the details for later.

* finish
  * A command which will grab your github username, add a dummy commit to close said issue, push to your fork, and present the PR page to go back to the company repo
