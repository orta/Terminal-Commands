Terminal-Commands
=================

Contains the Terminal commands I use on an everyday basis. Normally I just make gems for everything I do, but for short stuff it doesn't seem worth it. So I add this folder to my `$PATH` and build in here.

* start
  * A command which opens with either writing a new github issue or giving one as the first argument, creates a branch based on the id, and notes the details for later.

* finish
  * A command which will grab your github username, add a dummy commit to close said issue, push to your fork, and present the PR page to go back to the company repo.
